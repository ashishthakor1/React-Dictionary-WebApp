# React-Dictionary-WebApp

This is a simple react dictionary app

It will fetch data for entered word and show details of the word

If the word contain synonyms then it will also show it and if we click on any synonyms it will fetch data for that synonyms also.

It will print all synonyms in Alphabatic order.

This react app is completly responsive

And I hav also used "Ant Design" for showing notification after searching the word

I have deployed this Dictionary App on firebase and it's link is Below.
